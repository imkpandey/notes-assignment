## Learnings üí°

This was a simple project, or atleast I thought so initially. Saving the states in localStorage and persisting it was the major challenge I faced during this project. I used Material UI for styling this application, instead of Vanilla CSS only to save time. I also took the initiative to freely design the UI, simply to increase my chances of being selected, mainly because I am a very UI-centric developer.  Overall, it was a really fun assignment to work on, I learned a lot of things and feel free to ask me any questions about this project. Cheers!
