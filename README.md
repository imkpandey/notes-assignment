## How To Use

I took the initiative to redesign the given UI to simply increase my chances of being selected, mainly because I am a very UI-centric developer. I added a collapsible sidebar, along with dark and light modes for the application. I also made necessary UI assumptions about the layout of the table, specific to the application's performance. Overall, it was a really fun assignment to work on, I learned a lot of things and feel free to ask me any questions about this project. Cheers!
